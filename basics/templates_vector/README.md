Custom implemented Vector class in order to practice C++ templates. This is meant for me to learn langauge features, not have an efficient solution as the vector I have implemented is incredibly inefficient and resizing or adding/removing values.
  
Supports some of the standard Vector operations including:
- template declaration MyVector<int> mv(5)
